# VGSI House API

## How to build and run the solution 

## Notes about any improvements you'd like to make but did not have time to make

## Notes on any API design choices
I used Spring Boot Framework to develop this REST API, because it can shorten the code length and provide an easy way to develop Web Applications and it automatically configures the classes based on the requirement while reducing boilerplate code.  
In its default configuration, House API uses an embedded, in-memory database H2 which gets populated at startup with data extracted from CSV file. 

## Notes on the security implications of the implementation
